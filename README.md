# To-Do-List Logic Added as of 01/30/24:
  - add a task
  - delete a task
  - move a task up in priority
  - move a task down in priority

# Future increments I plan to add:
  - save the data of each task(localStorage)
  - add a checked off click event listener
  - more content
  - more design increments for better UI/UX
  - responsive design

# Methods Used and Learnt(React):
 - State Management with useState hook
 - onClick
 - onChange
 - Conditional Rendering
 - List Rendering(map, filter, trim)
 - Updater Functions for best practice
 - Array Destructuring 
 - Spread operator
